<h1>HPI Helpers</h1>
<p>
The HPI Helpers are a set of classes that can be used by the HPI test cases.
To put it simply, they provide for code re-use.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>
AlarmHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiAlarmT</code> structure as well
as modifying and querying the DAT.
</dd>

<dt>
AlarmSet
</dt>
<dd>
Represents a set of alarms.  
</dd>

<dt>
AnnouncementSet
</dt>
<dd>
Represents a set of Annunciator announcements.
</dd>

<dt>
AnnunciatorHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiAnnunciatorRecT</code>
and <code>SaHpiAnnouncementT</code> structures.
</dd>

<dt>
CharBuffer
</dt>
<dd>
This class makes simplifies the handling of characters.  In HPI, characters are
represented by bytes.  The <code>CharBuffer</code> class converts those bytes to characters
depending upon the data type: Unicode, Text, etc.  To put it simply, working with
the actual characters is simpler than working with a byte stream.  It is also
possible to convert a <code>CharBuffer</code> to a <code>SaHpiTextBufferT</code> for use with
the HPI functions.
</dd>

<dt>
ConditionHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiConditionT</code> structure.
</dd>

<dt>
ControlHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiCtrlRecT</code> structure.
</dd>

<dt>
EventHandler
</dt>
<dd>
The <code>EventHandler</code> class acts as an interface.  Derived classes that extend
<code>EventHandler</code> are able to register for callbacks for various types of event handling.
</dd>

<dt>
EventHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with HPI events.  Some of the methods allow
for manipulation of the <code>SaHpiEventT</code> structure.  Others allow for the waiting of
events, generating of events, and clearing of the event queue.
</dd>

<dt>
EventLogHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working the an Event Log.  Methods are availble for
determining if the Event Log is empty, adding entries to the log, filling the log entirely, 
overflowing the log, making room for adding new entries, and for finding entries in the log.
</dd>

<dt>
EventMatcher
</dt>
<dd>
The <code>EventMatcher</code> is used to match against events, typically those that
are being retrieved from the event queue.  The <code>EventMatcher</code> supports
the following attributes: Source, EventType, Severity, HotSwapState, SensorNum, 
SensorAssertion, and SensorEventState.  If and only if an attribute is set, then an incoming
event must match the values for those attributes that are set.
</dd>

<dt>
HotSwapHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for determining if the AutoInsertTimeout or AutoExtractTimeout
values can be changed.
</dd>

<dt>
HpiHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of generic static methods pertaining to HPI.
</dd>

<dt>
InventoryHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with IDRs, Areas, and Fields.
</dd>

<dt>
MinorAlarmGenerator
</dt>
<dd>
The <code>MinorAlarmGenerator</code>, as its name implies, is used to generate a
minor alarm.  It does this by finding a sensor threshold for which an UpMinor event
can be generated.  A method is also provided for clearing the alarm at a later time.
</dd>

<dt>
NameHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiNameT</code> structure.
</dd>

<dt>
RdrHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with the <code>SaHpiRdrT</code> structure.
</dd>

<dt>
ResourceHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with RPT entries, entity paths, and resource info.
</dd>

<dt>
SensorHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with sensors.  This includes sensor records,
readings, thresholds, etc.
</dd>

<dt>
TextBufferHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with Text Buffers.
</dd>

<dt>
UpMinorEventGenerator
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <code>UpMinorEventGenerator</code> is, as its name implies, used to generate
an UpMinor event.  The sensor's UpMinor threshold value is changed to be equal
to its LowMinor value.  Since the sensor's current reading will be between the
LowMinor and UpMinor values, the reading is now above the UpMinor.  This should
normally cause the UpMinor event to be generated.
The following is the typical sequence of steps for 
using this class.
</p>
<ol>

<li>
Create an instance of <code>UpMinorEventGenerator</code> for a specific sensor.
</li>

<li>
Use the method <code>canAssertEvent()</code> to determine if an event can be generated
for this sensor.  This might result in the sensor's settings being modified, i.e. a
disabled sensor may become enabled.
</li>

<li>
Optionally, invoke one of the methods to disable the sensor, event generation, or remove
an event mask.  These methods are only used by test cases that verify that the
event does not get generated. 
</li>

<li>
Invoke <code>assertEvent()</code> to cause the event (or non-event) to occur.
</li>

<li>
Invoke <code>deassertEvent()</code> to clear the event.
</li>

<li>
Invoke <code>restoreSensor()</code> to restore the sensor to its original values, i.e.
if the sensor was originally disabled, it will be disabled again.
</li>

</ol>
</dd>

<dt>
WatchdogHelper
</dt>
<dd>
Contains a set of static methods for working with watchdog data structures.
</dd>
