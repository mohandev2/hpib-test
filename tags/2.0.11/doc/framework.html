<h1>Base Test Framework</h1>
<p>
The Base Test Framework is a generic infrastructure for creating test suites.
</p>

<h2>Test Suites and Test Cases</h2>
<p>
All test suites and test cases are derived from <code>BaseTestSuite</code> and
<code>BaseTestCase</code>, respectively.  Test suites maintain a list of child tests.
These child tests are either other test suites or test cases, but cannot be
a mixture of the two.  In simple terms, a full test suite is organized as a
tree.  The root node and the interior nodes of the tree are test suites.
The leaf nodes are test cases.  
</p>

<p>
After a test case has been executed, it stores the result in a <code>TestStatus</code>.
</p>

<p>
The following shows the class diagram for tests.

<h2>Test Status</h2>

<p>
As mentioned above, each test case maintains the results of its execution in a <code>TestStatus</code>.
The below figure shows the class diagram for the <code>TestStatus</code>.  As can be seen, a <code>TestStatus</code>
consist of a state (UNKNOWN, PASS, FAIL, NOT_SUPPORT, ERROR, BLOCK) and an optional set of messages.
The messages are typically used to indicate the reason for an error or a failure.  Each message
consists of a string and a stack trace.  The stack trace indicates where in the source code that the error
or failure occurred.  The stack trace consists of one or more <code>StackTraceEntry</code>s.  Each stack trace
entry consists of the source code filename, function name, and line number.

<h2>The Controller, Executive, and HtmlGenerator</h2>

<p>
The <code>Controller</code> is responsible for what action to take when the test application is
run, based upon the command line options.  For example, it may be necessary to execute the
test cases or to create a set of web pages documenting the test cases.  The following figure 
shows the class diagram for the Controller.

</p>

<p>
The <code>Arguments</code> class is responsible for parsing the command line arguments.
</p>

<p>
The <code>HtmlGenerator</code> is used by the <code>Controller</code> when it is necessary to generate
the set of web pages.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Executive</code> is used by the <code>Controller</code> when it is necessary to execute
one or more test cases.  The <code>Controller</code> provides the <code>Executive</code> with the 
information from the command line arguments as to the names of which test cases to run 
and which to exclude.  The <code>Executive</code> works by obtaining a list of all of the test
cases from the root test suite, i.e. the test suite tree is recursively traversed to 
obtain all of the test cases at the leafs of the tree.   Based upon the names given by
the <code>Controller</code>, the <code>Executive</code> executes those test cases.
</p>

<p>
During execution of a test case, the test case can reference the <code>Executive</code>.  In this
way, test cases can make use of the <code>UserPrompter</code>.  The <code>UserPrompter</code> simply
prints a message for the user and waits for that user to press the Enter key.
</p>

<h2>Other Classes</h2>

<p>
The following are some other classes that make up the Base Test Framework.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>AppExit</dt>
<dd><code>AppExit</code> is used to terminate the test application when a fatal block occurs.
A fatal block occurs when a test case does not teminate within the specified timeout period.
A message is printed indicating the offending test case and with some possible reasons as
to why this has occurred.  Corrective action is required by the user.</dd>

<dt>HtmlToc</dt>
<dd><code>HtmlToc</code> is used to build the table of contents, i.e. the set of hyperlinks on 
left side of the web page showing the test suites.</dd>

<dt>LocationMgr</dt>
<dd><code>LocationMgr</code> is used to maintain which <i>location</i> that is being tested.  This
is a very abstract concept.  In terms of HPI, a location may be a domain, a resource, or an
rdr entry.  The <code>LocationMgr</code> mantains a stack in order to keep track of which <i>location</i>
is being tested.  For example, a resource might be identified as follows: [Domain:1; Resource:3].
When a message is added to a <code>TestStatus</code>, the current <i>location</i> is appended to the
message.
</dd>

<dt>Properties</dt>
<dd><code>Properties</code> is used to maintain the runtime properties, such as the timeout period
for test cases.</dd>

<dt>Report</dt>
<dd>A <code>Report</code> is simply a set of text messages that are appended together.  For an example
of its use, consider the comparison of two HPI structures.  For each field that is different, a
text message can be added to the <code>Report</code>.  A final big string can then be obtained from the
<code>Report</code>.
</dd>

<dt>Summary</dt>
<dd>The <code>Summary</code> is used to keep track of the total number of passed test cases, failed test
cases, etc..</dd>
