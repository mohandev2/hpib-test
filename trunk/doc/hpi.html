<h1>HPI Test Framework</h1>
<p>
The HPI Test Framework is an infrastructure for creating an HPI Test Suite.
</p>

<h2>HPI Test Suites and Test Cases</h2>
<p>
All HPI test suites and test cases are derived from <code>HpiTestSuite</code> and
<code>HpiTestCase</code>, respectively.  The following shows the class diagram for test
suites and test cases.
</p>

<p>
In the above class diagram, pay careful attention to the classes derived from
<code>HpiTestCase</code>.  The following describes the purpose of each of these different
types of HPI test cases.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>HpiGenTestCase</dt>
<dd>
The <code>HpiGenTestCase</code> is the base class for test cases that don't need to test
against all of the domains.  Either the test cases doesn't test against any domain
or it only needs to test against the default domain.
</dd>

<dt>HpiDomainTestCase</dt>
<dd>
The <code>HpiDomainTestCase</code> is the base class for those test cases that must
test against each domain in the HPI system.  It is the responsibility of the derived
class to open a session for the domain.
</dd>

<dt>HpiSessionTestCase</dt>
<dd>
The <code>HpiSessionTestCase</code> is the base class for the test cases that must
test against each domain and for which a session must be openned.  For a threaded
application, this class will also set a timer that will expire before the default
test timeout period.  If this timer expires, it is assumed that the test case is
blocked.  The session is then closed in an attempt to unblock the test case so
that the application will not terminate.
</dd>

<dt>HpiResourceTestCase</dt>
<dd>
The <code>HpiResourceTestCase</code> is the base class for the test cases that must
test against all of the resources in all of the domains.  Sessions will be openned
for each domain and the RPT will be traversed for each domain.
</dd>

<dt>HpiRdrTestCase</dt>
<dd>
The <code>HpiRdrTestCase</code> is the base class for the test cases that must
test against all of the RDR entries in all of the domains.  Sessions will be openned
for each domain and the RPT will be traversed for each domain.  For each resource
in the RPT that supports RDRs, the child test case will be invoked to test against
each RDR entry in that resource.
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>HPI Test Status</h2>

<p>
As shown in the below class diagram, <code>HpiTestStatus</code> is derived from <code>TestStatus</code>.
It provides extra methods for setting the state and adding messages based upon HPI error codes.
</p>

<h2>The HPI Executive and HPI Properties</h2>

<p>
The following class diagram shows the class derivation for <code>HpiExecutive</code> and 
<code>HpiProperties</code>.  <code>HpiExecutive</code> provides extends <code>Executive</code> by 
obtaining the Domain IDs in the HPI system before running the test cases.  It also
contains a reference to an instance of <code>HpiProperties</code> which contains all of
the runtime properties that can be changed by the property file <code>~/.hpitest</code>.
</p>

<h2>Other Classes</h2>

<p>
The following are some other classes that make up the HPI Test Framework.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
ErrorList
</dt>
<dd>
Some test cases might expect two or more possible HPI error codes.  The
<code>ErrorList</code> is used to specify those expected error codes.
</dd>

<dt>
HpiInvalidResourceTestCase
</dt>
<dd>
Many HPI functions require testing an Invalid Resource ID.  Those test
cases should be derived from <code>HpiInvalidResourceTestCase</code>.
</dd>

<dt>
HpiInvalidSessionTestCase
</dt>
<dd>
Many HPI functions require testing an Invalid Session ID.  Those test
cases should be derived from <code>HpiInvalidSessionTestCase</code>.
</dd>

<dt>
HpiNoCapabilityTestCase
</dt>
<dd>
Many HPI functions require testing a resource that does not support
the capability needed for that function.  Those test
cases should be derived from <code>HpiNoCapabilityTestCase</code>.
</dd>

<dt>
HpiString
</dt>
<dd>
<code>HpiString</code> is used to translate enumerations and other values into strings.
</dd>

<dt>
IdList
</dt>
<dd>
The <code>IdList</code> contains a list of HPI Domain IDs.  Currently used for
the list of domains that must be tested.
</dd>
