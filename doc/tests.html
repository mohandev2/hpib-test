<h1>HPI Tests</h1>

<p>
The HPI Test Suites and Test Cases are organized in a hierarchical tree-like fashion
and that is reflected in the directory structure.  Also, to avoid naming conflicts,
C++ namespaces are used.  The below diagram gives a small example on how the test suites
and test cases are organized.  The <code>RootTestSuite</code> is the top-level test suite
that contains all of the test suites and test cases.  Note that there are many C++ test
suites with the same name (<code>TestSuite</code>), but they use different namespaces.
Likewise, test cases are in the same namespace as the test suite that contains them.
It should be noted that the namespace corresponds to the directory that the C++ source
file is in.
